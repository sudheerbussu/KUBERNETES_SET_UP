Instructions to Run the Scripts:
On the Master Node:

Save the master script as setup_master.sh.

Make the script executable:


$chmod +x setup_master.sh
Run the script:

$./setup_master.sh
Copy the output join command; you'll use it on the worker nodes.

On Each Worker Node:

Save the worker script as setup_worker.sh.

Replace <join-command> in the script with the actual join command from the master node.

Make the script executable:
$chmod +x setup_worker.sh

Run the script:
$./setup_worker.sh

Verify the Cluster:
On the master node, run:

  
$kubectl get nodes
Ensure all nodes (master and workers) are listed with a STATUS of Ready.

Feel free to adapt these scripts to fit your specific setup or environment.
